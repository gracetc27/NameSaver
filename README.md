# NameSaver 
Challenge project 6 in my 100 days of SwiftUI- Hacking with Swift journey. This project was the next one to build with no help from tutorials. 
This project practices using mapKit and saving/loading data from the documents directory. It uses MVVM architecture. 
The user can add a new person to a list, adding their name, photo and any extra info. On save, it also saves their current location. 
When the user clicks into a person in the list, it displays their name, the extra info and their picture as a pin on the map at the location of where they were when they added them.
